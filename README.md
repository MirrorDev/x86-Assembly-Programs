# üõ†Ô∏è x86-Assembly-Programs

A collection of x86 Assembly language programs written using **Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)**. These examples are designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand the fundamentals of low-level programming on x86 architecture.

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside

This repository includes examples covering:

- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Looping and branching (FOR, WHILE, IF-ELSE constructs)
- String and character manipulation
- Input and output with DOS interrupts
- Working with registers and memory
- Basic algorithms (factorial, palindrome, sorting, etc.)

Each program is accompanied by comments for clarity and learning.
